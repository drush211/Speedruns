# Youtube

This document is made to shed light on how to work with a youtube account to
manage your speed runs, or any informational videos you might want to share.

## Twitch Sharing

Twitch offers the ability to create highlights which can be viewed both through
Twitch, and shipped to your Youtube account. You can use the Youtube video
manager to setup and manager your clips.

## Adsense

Adsense is Goggle's ad sharing/revenue program. It connects advertisements on
your videos to your account and let's you get paid for them. It has some
limitations on what you are allowed to receive compensation for, but in general
it seems to line up pretty closely with Youtubes Terms of Service.

## Terms of Service

From what I understand Youtube is much more aggressive as far as blocking
content with trademarked content. Where as Twitch will mute the offending part
of the cast, Youtube will remove it completely.

## Monetization

Youtube will not allow you to monetize just you playing a game, but per their
terms of service, you can monetize things that are informational/educational.
Therefore it seems like a tutorial or unique content would be able to be
monetized, as long as you are allowed to post content from the content creator.
i.e. You aren't doing copyright infringement.
