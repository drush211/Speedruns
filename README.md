# Speedruns

This repository is used to collect information on different speedruns and help
current and new players to the games improve. This repo will have markdown
guides as well as live split layouts/splits for different games.

## Livesplit

I use livesplit for maintaining all of my splits and layouts. Going forward all
references for how to do things will be based off of livesplit operations. More
info about livesplit including download information can be found [here][2].

## Methodology

Check out [this][5] document if you would like to understand a bit of my
methodology for learning how to speed run a game. This is an ever evolving
document, but it starts with how I have first started learning speed games.
Definitely not a one size fits all, and you should figure out how you learn
best, but it at least might be a starting point for you.
