# OBS

This document will talk about some of the things to do around managing your
stream with OBS. Some are OBS specific, and others are just general thoughts on
managing content your are streaming.

## Moving Parts

One of the first things I did as a streamer was utilize all of the space on the
screen. Obviously this seems intuitive, I mean after all why waste space? Well
do remember that you are sending bits of data across the interwebs. Not only
that, but you are also using your PC's CPU and Memory to manage this data. Add
to that the bandwidth needed to continuously send new data, and you are starting
to take on a lot of resource management. If you have the means, then feel free
of course, but something I noticed was that I would sometimes have some lag in
my stream if I was playing something that was a little more detailed
graphically. A way I counteracted that was to minimize my moving parts. I setup
a background, then trimmed my game screen to fit a section. I did this with my
camera and livesplit as well, and utilized a background image to lessen the
feeling of dead space. Overall I barely reduced my quality via size (if it
really impacted anyone at all), and improved my quality via content. Less frame
drops and a background that gives a feel for the game instead of just the game
itself brings the viewer more into the setting.

## Stream Key

In order to stream to twitch you should go to Settings->Stream and input the
server closest to you (note that this might not always be the fastest, so play
around with it as necessary) and go to
`https://www.twitch.tv/{user}/dashboard/streamkey` to get your key to input.
