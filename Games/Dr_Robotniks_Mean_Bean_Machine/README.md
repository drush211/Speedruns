# Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine

Think Dr. mario, but with a twist. Cool little block puzzle game where
you are trying to get 4 of the same color connected together to remove
them from your board. The twist is that if you make a connection, that
removes blocks which then make another connection, you dump rocks on
your opponent potentially messing up their board.
