# General Knowledge

This is meant to be a catch all of general knowledge techniques that can be
applied to most any route/run type.

## Stutter Stepping

You can stutter step over the world map to skip encounters. Do note that you
don't need to do this when a continent marker is up.

## Mashing

Alternate **SQUARE** and **X** for optimal mashing.

## ATB Wait Trick

When you enter a submenu during battle (magic, attack targeting, items, etc),
all ATB bars stop filling, and queued commands are not executed. Animations that
are already in progress will still finish however. Note that time is also
stopped for stuff such as the duration of Reflect, or healing by Auto-Regen.
What we call "the ATB wait trick" is a useful application of this that looks as
follows: the boss is executing their attack, and one of your characters has a
command queued up. With another character, you enter a submenu. Once the boss's
attack finishes, you quickly exit and re-enter the submenu, allowing your
character's command to start executing without letting the boss's ATB gauge
fill. Once your character's command finishes, you can exit the submenu again
(or execute a command with this character), causing the ATB gauges of your
character and the boss to start filling up at the same time. Note that this is
only useful if your character's speed is greater than that of the boss, since
otherwise the boss will still get to go before you and you have only succeeded
in wasting a few seconds while you wait for their bar to fill up. This severely
limits the use of this trick, and I only use it in a couple of battles in the
run, which I will point out as they come up. There may be other places where it
can be used though, so feel free to experiment with it yourself.
