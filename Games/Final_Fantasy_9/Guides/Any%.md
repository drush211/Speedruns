# Final Fantasy 9

Any % run on Steam. I based a lot of my notes off the guide found [here][1].

## Mage Masher (Split 1)

  * Everyone steal until you get the mage masher. Note a wrist pickup. Suicide.
  * 2nd selection for answer. (Don't mash!)

## Leo (Split 2)

  * Vivi tour. Don't forget tent in chapel to the left.
  * Defeat the twins, then Leo. Don't use Cinna.

## Bo-bomb!!! (Split 3)

  * Swordfight, note 100 nobles if you get it. NO ENCORES!!!
  * Menu
    * Zidane - Optimize (Mage Masher Equip)
  * Steiner name screen after Zorne and Thorne talk to the queen.
  * Steiner 1 - 2 Zidane hits, steal with others for Silk Shirt. Can
                continue without Silk Shirt.
  * Steiner 2/3 - Suicide. Garnet kills worst ATB.
