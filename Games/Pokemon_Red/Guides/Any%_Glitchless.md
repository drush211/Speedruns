# Pokemon Red

Any% run using an emulator currently (I own the 3DS Digital Version, but don't
want to get the hookups for it). I've based my notes off of the ones found
[here][1].

## Useful General Information

### Red Bar

Getting your health into red bar keeps pokemon from doing their cry at the
beginning of the fight. This can save a second or 2 depending on the pokemon. Of
course it's pretty risky to be at low health the whole game, but no risk no
reward after all.

### Horn Drill and X Accuracy

Horn Drill is an instant kill move, but it's really hard to hit. That is why we
use X Accuracy before using it. X Accuracy removes the accuracy check before an
attack, meaning every hit after an X Accuracy is guaranteed to land.

### Hidden Items

We collect a lot of hidden items in the route, so it's useful to know where most
of them are. I try to have images any time you need to pick something up, but
[here][4] is a good catalog of the hidden items through the game.
