# Pokemon Red

Any% run using an emulator currently. I've based my notes off of the ones found
[here][1].

## Useful General Information

### Red Bar

Getting your health into red bar keeps pokemon from doing their cry at the
beginning of the fight. This can save a second or 2 depending on the pokemon. Of
course it's pretty risky to be at low health the whole game, but no risk no
reward after all.

## Before Staring (Split 0)

  * Clear any existing save file by pressing Up + B + Select on the game title
      screen 
  * Set text speed to FAST, battle animation to OFF and battle style to SHIFT

## Gary 1 (Split 1)

  * Give yourself and rival a one character name.
  * Withdraw potion from the PC in your home.
  * Choose Squirtle (2nd pokeball) and give it a one character name.
  * **Gary**
    * _Bulbasaur Lvl 5_
    * Tail whip, then spam tackle. If growled on turn 1, then do a 2nd tail
      whip. Use a potion if under 5 HP.

## Nidoran (Split 2)

  * Head to Viridian City.
  * Fight a Lvl 2-3 Rattata or Pidgey for the experience. You need this for
    bubble to fight Brock.
  * Get Oak's Parcel from the Mart, then head back to Pallet Town to return it.
    Walk behind Oak to save some steps from Gary.
  * Head back to Viridian City.
  * Mart

  * Head west to Route 22.
  * Catch a Lvl 3 or 4 Nidoran (Male) and give it a one character name.
    * Tackle Lvl 3 Nidorans once before PokeBall. Lvl 4 just chuck a PokeBall at
      unless low on balls, then tackle twice.

## Brock (Split 3)

  * Pick up the hidden tree potion north of Viridian City.
  * Head to Viridian Forest.
  * Use this [map][2] to get through the forest with minimal battles.
  * Pick up the antidote on the way up.
  * Heal to 10+ HP for Weedle Guy and pick up the potion before him.
