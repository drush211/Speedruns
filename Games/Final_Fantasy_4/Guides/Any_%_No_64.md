# Any % No 64

These [notes][1] are based off the ones that [The_Roth][2] has. He is the
current world record holder for No 64, and can't be given enough credit for
making this guide possible.

## General Notes

The next few sections will be general info on useful techniques used in the run.
For more detailed info, follow the links to the more informative guides.

### Run Buffering

Running in battles where you can’t run halts the ATB while the “can’t run”
message appears. If you complete an action while this message is displayed your
party members act earlier in battle (e.g. Fabul fights) and it makes fights
faster/safer. If the message disappears and you are in the middle of targeting a
monster, you need to run buffer again right after confirming an action to still
act earlier.

### MP Underflow

This forces the game to cast more MP than what you have. Since games only store
positive numbers in the RAM, you end up having ~ 65500 MP after underflowing.
You can only cast magic in battles though.

  * Go into Tellah’s Menu and Cast Cure 4 on people until you can’t cast it any
    more.
  * Select Cure4 once.
  * Press down (to hover on the spell Sight – you need 2 MP still).
  * Press Up + A at the same time.
  * If done properly you are able to to cast Cure4 on your party (otherwise you
    will hear the “BRR” sound)
  * To remove the underflow status, simply use an Ether on Tellah out of battle.

### General Info

  * Try to predict which character acts next, sometimes you can hold A to attack
    immediately
  * Remember where you are when you get encounters so you can start walking
    straight away.
  * Hold X while walking to enter the menu without delay.
  * For single text boxes just mash quickly. For longer text, try to mash
    rhythmically and look at the screen. It’s hard to explain but you’ll get the
    gist of it.
  * You can mash with any button, e.g. in item shops you can press A once to buy
    an item and then press down twice to select the next item (avoids buying two
    of one item by accident).
  * You can change rows in the Form menu by pressing left or right before
    selecting characters.
  * Press X to increase the # of items bought by 10, or to change from White to
    Black magic.
  * You can act in the menu quicker than you think, i.e. while the boxes are
    sliding around.
  * Paladin Cecil will take damage for anyone under ¼ HP provided he isn’t
    Parrying or weakened. You’ll only ever need to Cure2 Cecil during Valvalis
    or Calbrena. If you ever need to do nothing with Cecil, have him Cover
    anyone or use an item, never Parry with him.

### Killing People in Boss Fights

The level that characters rejoin your party (i.e. Kain, Yang, Adult Rydia etc)
is affected by the total experience your party gains over the game, so it’s
better to kill off people in boss fights to have people join at higher levels.
We make sure 2 party members are dead for Dark Elf (or MilonZ), Flame Dog and
Magus Sisters to have Kain rejoin at level 19 which makes Valvalis, Calbrena and
Golbez really easy. You don’t need to do this but keep it in mind if you want to
get really fast times.
