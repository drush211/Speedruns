# Mist Dragon

The fight with Mist Dragon follows a set pattern, where we will do

  1. Kain Jump
  2. Cecil Attack
  3. Cecil Attack
  4. Kain Jump
  5. Cecil Attack
  6. Cecil Attack
  7. Kain Attack

To get 7 attacks in before it turns into mist. Now do a parry with Cecil to get
to Kain, and wait to jump until you hear the music [cue][1]. Watch a tutorial
for the queue as it's impossible to verbalize, but easy to watch. At this point
Kain will hit the dragon as soon as it transforms again.

During the time that Kain is in the air you also need to duplicate the shadow
shield. To do this you should go to the item menu and select the first empty
slot on the right. Then go select the shield to move it there. Then select the
empty shield slot and go back to the now empty slot on the right (shield will
be on the left) and select it to duplicate the shield. Then you will continue
attacking with Cecil and jumping with Kain.
