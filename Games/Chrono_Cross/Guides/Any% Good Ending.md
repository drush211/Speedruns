# Chrono Cross

Any % run on Vita currently. I based a lot of my notes off the guides found
[here][1] (Can't overstate the use of EvilAsh's notes and run from RPG Limit
Break I filled in some new runner gaps, but this is basically just an extension
of his notes.) and [here][3], as well as the speedrun from [RPG Limit Break][4].
