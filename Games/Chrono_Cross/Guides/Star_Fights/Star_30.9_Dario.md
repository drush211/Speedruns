# Dario

This isn't really a star fight, but definitely deserves it's own guide.

## Strategy Concept

We are looking to get Dario in a loop here. Luckily this is not a star fight, so
as long as you get him in the loop with Marcy don't worry about people who die.
The first part of the fight is setting up for maximum magic damage. He has quite
a bit of HP, so we will need several spells from Marcy to knock him down. You
need a little bit of luck with the stamina refreshes as well.
