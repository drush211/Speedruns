## Strategy Concept

Very adaptive fight since it is fairly long given Lynx's HP. Longer fights mean
more misses, which then causes a longer fight. Really shitty cycle isn't it? The
pilfer is a way to manipulate the Imbecile element, and Dash & Slash actually
draws out an anti-white element here. Ideally you don't need that last bit of
info.
