## Strategy Concept

This fight is mostly getting to WightKnight and hitting as hard as possible, but
it goes a little different if you get attacked before Sprigg becomes
WightKnight. In that case you basically get a turn in with WightKnight before
the TurnBlack since you are tracking against his AP counter.
